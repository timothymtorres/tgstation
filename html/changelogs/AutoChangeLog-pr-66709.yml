  - qol: "When ventcrawling, rather then jumping between pipes, your view will \"glide\""
  - qol: "When ventcrawling, holding two directions no longer locks you in place. Instead behaving as expected"
  - qol: "Ventcrawling now darkens the background while you're doing it. Hopefully this looks slightly better then the fullbright of current."
  - code_imp: "Ventcrawling code has had a 99% performance increase. I am not joking. Won't lag the server anymore."
