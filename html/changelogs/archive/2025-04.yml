  Ghommie:
  - bugfix: Fish will no longer drown if left half-submerged in a fishable turf on
      which it can normally be found. Instead it will disperse after a while or if
      starving. Note that this only happens if the fish is native to such turfs (eg.
      lavaloop on beach water will still die).
  SmArtKar:
  - bugfix: Fixed gas station and phonebooth ruins magically summoning weather on
      bottom levels of Icebox
2025-04-02:

      \ by server system timezone changes"
  - bugfix: "Station and round times will not longer be incorrect if the system timezone\
      \ is not UTC\xB10"
  Y0SH1M4S73R:
  - code_imp: Any tgui message that would be too big to send to the server is now
      split into chunks and sent in sequence. This fixes several issues, such as...

  jlsnow301:
  - bugfix: Fixed the circuit UI titlebar spacing
  - bugfix: The library console has been refactored. Report any issues in the github!

  - code_imp: Runtime errors will now print to the chat while debugging.
  Melbert:
  - refactor: Minor mining voucher refactor, report any oddities.

      invocations.
  - qol: '"Unknown" mobs are now properly referred to as they/them'
  - qol: Burning paper (and similar) is now two way. Rather than needing to click
      on the paper with a burning item, you can now click on a burning item with the
      paper. This means you can burn paper on your lit cigarette like a badass.
  - qol: You can now light cigarettes on candles.
  - rscdel: Flares and candles can no longer craft into flashlight eyes, I guess.
2025-04-04:

  necromanceranne:
  - bugfix: Attempts were made to make chemical interactions with regards to splashes
      or exposure to chemicals on your skin respect clothing cover. If you have clothing
      with biological protecting properties, chemicals may not affect you as easily.
      Good for you.
  - balance: Some chems may behave differently than they originally did in light of
      utilizing suit protections appropriately. Make sure if you want someone to be
      exposed to the full effect of a chemical that they're not wearing anything in
      the way before splashing them.
2025-04-05:

      inefficient.

  - rscadd: New Medical bounty! Scan crewmates who have been healed or currently have
      a clean bill of health, and ship the medical report to prove that you're not

      bounties are worth about half as much.
  - rscadd: Mechs can be sold on the cargo shuttle for the remaining half of the value
      from previous mech bounties.

      a new bounty from the civilian bounty console.

  - balance: kronkaine now causes heart damage in a dose dependant manner, instead
      of a flat value.
  - balance: kronkus seed packs are now three times as common.
  - balance: the kronkaine anti-purging disease now only triggers if you take stamina
      damage while using purging chems.
  - balance: the kronkaine reaction uses less ammonia and welding fuel.
  - rscadd: added an alternative kronkaine reaction that uses lye instead of ammonia.

  - qol: Adds a hunger tier between hungry and starving (for mood)

      shocks.
  - balance: Heart attacks can now be treated and eventually cured with repeated shocks

      provide sleep immunity.

  - qol: The active sonar module has been slightly tweaked, resulting in smoother
      updates & a red tinge on highlighted humans.
  hry-gh:
  - qol: there's a new UI preference called UI scale which allows people that use
      windows scaling to have their UIs original size with the contents zoomed out,
      instead of the default, which is the UIs being larger with the contents "normal"
      size
  - bugfix: various UIs did not respect windows scaling, they now do
  - bugfix: admins trying to play certain songs would crash the chat, it no longer
      does
