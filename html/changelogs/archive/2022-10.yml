  vincentiusvin:
  - rscdel: Removed the broken pressure power multiplier which always evaluates to
      2. Multiplied base SM power production by 2.
  - rscdel: SM will no longer gain power when exposed to space. It actually used to
      do that, but only when the tile it's on has gas so you don't really notice it.
  - qol: added the factor breakdowns to the SM ui.
  - qol: added the gas effect breakdowns to the SM ui.
  - qol: Made the supermatter selection in NT CIMS ui frontend based. Notifications
      will be based on you pressing the bell button instead of opening a SM page.

      CIMS will show you the exact gas mixture that it uses for calculation.

      damage around space (added 2020, last modified 2022). Chose the latter formula,
      it's significantly stronger.

      damage. Instead of the old fixed healing at ~313K.
  - balance: made the low mole heat resistance thing on SM not scale with heat resistant
      gases.
  - balance: Made the supermatter temperature power gain multiplier thing linear at
      1/6 instead of 50/273 or 30/273.
  - balance: Psychologist heat reduction is weaker on high heat gas.
  - refactor: rerouted how external damage (bullets) and external power (emitter)
      is applied to SM.
  - refactor: restructured the internal power calculations for SM. Power should be
      applied on each atmos tick instead of separately.
  - refactor: restructured how the SM calculates the damage that it takes. No changes
      expected except for the low mole temp limit multiplier thing.
  - refactor: Restructured SM pluox generation and miasma consumption. No changes
      expected though.
